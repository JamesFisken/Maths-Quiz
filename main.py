    decomposition
    1) Ask the user for their name and set this to a variable so that we can refer to them later in the program

    2) Create a function that presents users with a question and allows them to pick an answer from multiple choices
    A. create another function(or maybe a class) to check whether a user clicks within a buttons hitbox
    B. darken questions that are clicked by the user
    C. allow this function to takein a background to also display to the user

    3)create multiple maths question
    A. make these maths questions vary in difficulty
    B. make the questions harder the more they succeed

    4) After completing the quiz display to users their mistakes and overall percentage on the test
    a. record what questions they got wrong
    b) find a percentage using the total questions divided by the number of questions they got right they got right

    5) Ask the user whether they want to try again(show improvements over time)
